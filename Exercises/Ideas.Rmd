## Parsing Graphics

<http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2007/12/15/us/politics/DEBATE.html?_r=0>

* How many layers are there?  (Make separate judgments for static and dynamic)
* For each layer, what is the frame?
* For each frame, what does the data table look like that underlies the graph?


Lots of examples of visualizations: <http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/data-visualized-more-on-teaching-with-infographics/?action=click&module=Search&region=searchResults&mabReward=relbias%3Ar&url=http%3A%2F%2Fquery.nytimes.com%2Fsearch%2Fsitesearch%2F%3Faction%3Dclick%26region%3DMasthead%26pgtype%3DHomepage%26module%3DSearchSubmit%26contentCollection%3DHomepage%26t%3Dqry401%23%2Fdata+visualization>

Trajectory infographic: explain what the glyphs are and what data they encode.

## Making Graphics

Create a scatter plot showing the location of the world's largest cities.  Code the population glyph with a radius that's the square-root of the population.  Use colors to indicate countries or deciles of the population, or regions.

`CaseStudies/Cities/ListOfCities.RData`

## Summarize

Find the mean of the latitude and longitude for each country.  Plot these out with total urban population as the glyph size.

`CaseStudies/Cities/ListOfCities.RData`

## Join

Find the population of each country.  Join this with the population in cities $> 1,000,000$.  Make a map showing the "large urban population fraction" in each country.

Also need to join in the country names.
