This needs to be brought forward to 2013 --- a student can do this.

### Topics

***densities*** ***fields*** ***group***

### Simple

1) Show the different densities of net time for men and women
2) Show net time versus age: ***scatter*** ***hexbin*** 
3) Fit a smoother of time versus age.  Are they different for men and women?
4) Fit individual models and report back the slope.


See plots in the associated CherryBlossom.pdf file.
